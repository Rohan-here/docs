## Overview

In Creatr, editing and deploying your web app is quick and intuitive. Whether you’re refining individual elements, adding new components, or deploying different versions via Version History, our AI-powered workflow makes it easy to stay agile and bring your vision to life.

## Editing Your Web App

### 1. AI-Powered Edits

Begin by entering a prompt that describes the changes you’d like to make. Our AI will analyze your request and generate the modifications needed for your web app. You can also attach images or documents to provide extra context.

**Example Prompt:**

```plaintext
"Change the header background to a gradient from blue to green."
```

<img

  src="/images/editing-ai.png"
  alt="AI-Powered Editing - Dark Mode"
/>

### 2. Selecting Elements

Activate the **Select Element** tool to target specific parts of your web app. When you hover over elements, a border highlights them, allowing you to isolate and edit individual components with precision.

  src="/images/select-element.png"

/>
<img

  src="/images/select-element.png"
  alt="Select Element Tool - Dark Mode"
/>

### 3. Adding Components

Browse the Component Library to find pre-built UI elements—such as forms, carousels, or buttons—that you can add to your project. Simply select a component and instruct the AI to integrate it into your layout.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
  src="/images/component-library.png"
  alt="Component Library - Light Mode"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
  src="/images/component-library.png"
  alt="Component Library - Dark Mode"
/>

### 4. Refining Through Editing

Once your initial layout is generated, use the Creatr workspace to make fine adjustments:
- **Layout and Style:** Tweak positioning, colors, and typography.
- **Integrate Assets:** Add or update images, icons, and other media.
- **Leverage the Knowledge Base:** Refer to your project guidelines for consistency. (We’ll cover the Knowledge Base in detail on another page.)

## Deploying Your Web App

### 1. One-Click Deployment

When you’re satisfied with your edits, click the **Deploy** button in the top bar. In just 2–3 seconds, your web app goes live, and you receive a shareable URL.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
  src="/images/deploy.png"
  alt="Deploy Web App - Light Mode"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
  src="/images/deploy.png"
  alt="Deploy Web App - Dark Mode"
/>

### 2. Version Management

Work on new features or experiment with design changes using the Version History module. You can:
- **Switch Versions:** Preview and revert to earlier iterations.
- **Deploy Alternative Versions:** Test new ideas or roll out special releases without affecting your main project.
