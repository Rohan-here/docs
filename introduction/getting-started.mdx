## From Vision to Live Web App

This guide will take you step-by-step through transforming your idea into a live, production-ready web application using Creatr’s AI-powered platform. Follow these simple steps to bring your vision to life without the hassle of traditional development.

### 1. Define Your Vision

Begin by articulating your web app idea with clarity. A well-crafted prompt sets the foundation for a tailored codebase that perfectly matches your vision.

**Example Prompt:**

```plaintext
"Develop a modern landing page for a tech startup featuring interactive UI elements and bold, vibrant colors."
```

### 2. Refine Your Idea

Use the **Enhance Prompt** feature to let Creatr’s advanced AI polish your initial concept. This step helps ensure the generated webapp aligns closely with your expectations.

- **Review AI Suggestions:** Examine the enhancements and fine-tune as needed.
