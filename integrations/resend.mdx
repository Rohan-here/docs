## Overview

Resend integration empowers your application with reliable email delivery capabilities—perfect for sending welcome messages, password resets, newsletters, and more. 
<br /><br />**Note:** Before you begin, ensure you’ve already integrated Supabase with Creatr (including Edge Functions), as Resend relies on those functions to handle email tasks.

## What You’ll Need

- **Resend API Key:** Obtain this from your Resend account.
- **Domain (Optional):** A custom domain to send emails from (e.g., `yourdomain.com`).
- **Sender Email:** The email address that recipients will see in the “From” field.

## 1. Verify Your Supabase Integration

Confirm that:
- **Supabase** is integrated with your Creatr project.
- **Edge Functions** are enabled in Supabase.

Resend leverages Supabase Edge Functions to manage email delivery, so these prerequisites are essential.

## 2. Access the Resend Integration Popup

In your Creatr dashboard, navigate to **Integrations** and select **Resend**. You’ll see a popup prompting you to connect your Resend account:

/>

  src="/images/resend-popup.png"
  alt="Resend Integration Popup - Dark Mode"
/>

## 3. Enter Your Resend API Key

- **API Key Field:** Paste in your Resend API key.  
- **Alternate Storage:** If you prefer, you can store this key in your Supabase dashboard and reference it from there.

```plaintext
re_****
```

> **Tip:** Keep your API key private. Never commit it to public repositories.

## 4. (Optional) Configure a Custom Domain

If you’d like to send emails from your own domain (e.g., `hello@yourdomain.com`):
1. Enter your domain name in the popup.  
2. Follow Resend’s domain verification steps (DNS records, etc.) to finalize your custom domain setup.

## 5. Specify Sender Email

In the **Sender Email** field, input the address from which your emails will be sent. This will appear in recipients’ inboxes under the “From” field.

## 6. Finalize and Deploy

- **Review Configuration:** Double-check your API key, domain (if any), and sender email.  
- **Connect Resend:** Click **Connect Resend** to complete the integration.  
- **Deployment:** Once everything is set, deploy your project. Supabase Edge Functions will handle the email sending process behind the scenes.

## Testing Your Integration

After deployment, send a test email to ensure:
- Emails are delivered successfully.
- Your domain (if configured) is properly applied.
- The “From” address matches your Sender Email.
- Any errors are logged and can be viewed in Supabase’s Edge Functions logs.

By following these steps, you’ll seamlessly integrate Resend into your Creatr project via Supabase Edge Functions—giving you a reliable, scalable way to send emails from your web app. Happy building!
