## Supabase Edge Functions Integration

Supabase Edge Functions are serverless functions that let you run custom logic at the edge, ensuring low latency and high performance for your applications. With Creatr AI, integrating these functions into your project becomes a seamless, intuitive process.

### Key Benefits

- **Low Latency:** Execute functions near your users for faster response times.
- **Scalability:** Automatically scale your functions based on demand.
- **Seamless Integration:** Connect edge functions effortlessly with Supabase’s robust backend services.

### How to Integrate Supabase Edge Functions with Creatr AI

#### 1. Access the Edge Functions Module
In your Creatr dashboard, navigate to the Supabase Integration section and select the **Edge Functions** module. This dedicated space lets you create, manage, and monitor your serverless functions with ease.

#### 2. Define Your Function
Use Creatr AI to describe the functionality you need. For instance, you might enter a prompt like:

```plaintext
"Create an edge function that validates user sessions and logs activity data."
```

Creatr AI will generate a base template for your function, tailored to your requirements.

#### 3. Customize Your Function
Once the initial code is generated, you can:
- **Edit the Code:** Make custom modifications directly in the Creatr editor.
- **Test Locally:** Run tests to ensure your function works as intended.
- **Add Dependencies:** Incorporate any necessary libraries or SDKs for additional functionality.

#### 4. Configure Function Settings
Set up your edge function with the desired parameters:
- **Triggers:** Define the events or HTTP endpoints that will activate your function.
- **Environment Variables:** Input any necessary configuration variables.
- **Scaling Options:** Adjust settings to ensure your function scales automatically based on user demand.

#### 5. Deploy Your Edge Function
After customization and testing, deploy your function directly from Creatr. Your edge function will be hosted on Supabase, ready to handle real-time requests and integrate seamlessly with your app’s backend.

#### 6. Monitor and Iterate
Utilize Creatr’s integrated monitoring tools to track your function's performance. Continuously refine your code using feedback and AI-driven suggestions to optimize its efficiency and reliability.
